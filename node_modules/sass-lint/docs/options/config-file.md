# Config File

Option `config-file` will tell Sass Lint the path to a custom config file. `config-file` should be set to a path plus file name relative to where Sass Lint is being run from. If not included, Sass Lint will attempt to find the closest config file, or fall back to the default one.

Config File will only be respected if passed in as an option directly, not if it is already in a config file.
