# GONZALES-PE-SL FORK CHANGES

As of 3.2.6 The sasstools team decided to fork and maintain a separate copy of gonzales-pe named gonzales-pe-sl. Our intention is to still provide fixes etc back into gonzales-pe but at the same time allow sass-lint and anyone else who feels like they want to depend on this fork to continue and progress with any issues that remain unfixed/unmerged in the base repository. We will be looking to support this fork for as long as is necessary.

## 27.04.2016, Version 3.2.8
:green_apple: - Fixed a nested child selectors bug for Sass and SCSS format [#8](https://github.com/DanPurdy/gonzales-pe/pull/8)

:green_apple: - Fixed an in issue with functions inside `url()` [#5](https://github.com/DanPurdy/gonzales-pe/pull/5)

## 21.04.2016, Version 3.2.7
